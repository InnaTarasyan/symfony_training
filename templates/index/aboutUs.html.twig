                        Hi :) Let me introduce myself. I am Inna Tarasyan, I am web developer. My passion is designing and constructing beautiful, simple in use web applications. <br/>
                        You can see the list of my Web Sites here, on the Portfolio page. <br/>
                        I was also working on Android apps implementations, so please feel free and take a look on my projects also here, on the Portfolio page.
                        I have written those Android apps while I was a student, so , please, don't be strict :) More than 2500 times those applications were installed from Amazon.
                        Unfortunately, for downloading most applications you will have to pay. In order to download them free of charge, please, write me.
                        Web Applications are written for the purpose of working out some web technologies, and also because I LOVE that so much :)
                        I'll be grateful for all your remarks and notes regarding my works.  Please write :) <br/>

                        I am available for remote work, as a Web Developer - if you would like to build something together, get in touch.
